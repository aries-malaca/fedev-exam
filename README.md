This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Technologies

Application Framework (NextJS) - Server-side rendering, with built-in optimization. Also this framework ships with Tailwind out-of-the-box.

CSS Framework (Tailwind) - Good for small to large scale projects. I chose this to save time, instead of writing CSS classes etc. from scratch I could utilize the default styles provided by Tailwind.
